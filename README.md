# Brewnbeer HTML/CSS Gulp Boilerplate

**Brewnbeer HTML/CSS Gulp Boilerplate** is a standardized boilerplate that serves as a foundation for creating HTML/CSS projects. It provides a set of tools and configurations to streamline the development process.

## Features

- Gulp task runner for automating repetitive tasks
- Live reloading for efficient development
- Sass compiler for enhanced CSS preprocessing
- Autoprefixer for automatic vendor prefixing
- CSS and JavaScript minification for optimized files
- File concatenation for improved performance
- Image optimization for reduced file sizes
- Easy project customization and configuration

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that the following dependencies are installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 10 or higher)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) (globally installed)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   npm install
   ```

3. Customize the project:

   - Update the project name, description, and other details in the `package.json` file.
   - Modify the directory structure as per your project requirements.
   - Add your HTML files to the `src` directory.
   - Write your CSS using Sass syntax in the `src/scss` directory.
   - Customize the Gulp tasks in the `gulpfile.js` file to fit your project needs.

4. Launch the development server:

   ```bash
   gulp serve
   ```

   This command will initiate a local development server, open your project in a web browser, and watch for any changes you make. Whenever you save your files, the changes will be automatically reloaded in the browser.

5. Build for production:

   ```bash
   gulp build
   ```

   Executing this command will generate optimized and minified production-ready files in the `dist` directory.
